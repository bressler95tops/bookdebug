Elsevier partners with the research community to empower open science and is thrilled to support NASA's Year of Open Science. We are committed to advancing open and trusted research which we believe will benefit research and society, and accelerate research performance and progress. In line with this we actively support and enable researchers to make their research (including research data and software) openly available, without ever compromising on the things the research community trusts us for: quality, rigorous peer review and research integrity. We see the reform of research evaluation as a key pillar of open science, and a fundamental driver for change in research culture especially with respect to improving careers, and reward and recognition. We recognize that diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility are key facets of openness and transparency in research and are prerequisites for tackling the challenges of our time. Our effort to increase equity in accessing and publishing research is just one part of our Inclusion and Diversity program at Elsevier. We look forward to collaborating with federal agencies, including NASA, and other Year of Open Science signatories on ways to advance sustainable open science.
