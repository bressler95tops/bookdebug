FAS is a nonprofit, nonpartisan policy research organization working to develop and implement innovative ideas in science and technology. By providing new avenues for public engagement in policy design, we work to democratize the conversation around both science's impact on policy and policyâ€™s impact on science. 

## FAS's Year of Open Science Goal
Building on the incredible momentum in federal open science policy, we plan to use our platform to:

1. Source policy recommendations that can solidify the activities of the Year of Open Science and expand the scope of future open science initiatives
2. Engage a wide range of voices from across fields to help grow the conversation around open science in government
3. Inform thoughtful approaches to balancing the goals of open science, transparency, innovation, and security
