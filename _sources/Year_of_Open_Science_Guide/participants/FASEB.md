The Year of Open Science provides FASEB with a unique opportunity to both celebrate the benefits of open science and collaborate with member societies and funding agencies to give useful feedback on developing public access policies. Alongside FASEB's 26 member societies representing over 110,000 scientists, we are laying out our vision for building blocks needed for successful open science, including the integral nature of research integrity in this conversation. (Darla Henderson, PhD, Director FASEB Open Science and Research Integrity)
