At Frontiers we commend NASA for encouraging and prioritizing open science, not only within the agency but throughout the federal government. We wholly support the Year of Open Science and its many educational initiatives; they bring accountability, transparency, and trust to the scientific process. Frontiers wants to see all science open, so that scientists can collaborate better and innovate faster, for fairer and more equitable outcomes in all parts of society. That is our social purpose as a business. As a Gold Open Access publisher, we have made thousands of peer-reviewed articles available online immediately, without embargo. Our starting point - and end point - is ease of discovery. With widespread adoption of open science - backed by the latest knowledge that is globally shared, free to read, and open to all - we can manage and reverse global, existential threats to live healthy lives on a healthy planet.
