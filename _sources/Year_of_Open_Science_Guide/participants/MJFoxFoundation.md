"The Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research builds its research strategy around improving the lives of people with Parkinson's. Open science is a crucial part of that strategy. It allows us to share knowledge, collaborate with experts and drive progress towards new treatments and, ultimately, a cure. By openly sharing data and research findings, we can accelerate discovery and improve the lives of millions of people living with Parkinson's disease." - Todd Sherer, PhD, Chief Mission Officer of the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's Research
