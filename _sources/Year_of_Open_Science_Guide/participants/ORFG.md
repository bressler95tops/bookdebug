Closed systems slow progress and overlook those most impacted by the problems science needs to solve. This is why the Open Research Funders Group is joining federal agencies, colleges and universities, and others in embracing the Year of Open Science. While open scholarship alone will not solve the existential crises we face today, it better positions us as both a research ecosystem and as a society to optimize our chances of finding lasting and inclusive solutions. Open scholarship makes science more efficient at a moment when we donâ€™t have much margin for error.
