SPARC is a nonprofit advocacy organization representing college and university libraries. We believe sharing knowledge is a human right and that everyone should be able to access, contribute to, and benefit from the knowledge that shapes our world. Open Science is a critical enabling strategy in achieving this goal. To promote progress toward this end, we drive policy change, support member action, and cultivate communities that accelerate the adoption of open science policies and practices. The Year of Open Science demonstrates a strong commitment from federal research agencies to ensure equitable knowledge sharing across the research enterprise and beyond. We are thrilled to partner on this important endeavor!
