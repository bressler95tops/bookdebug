# Year of Open Science: Goals for Organizations

**To sign up your organization, please fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/KPKaejc2WP7dm5XVA).**

## Expectations for Organizations Joining a Year of Open Science 

TOPS is asking participating organizations to set a Year of Open Science goal, aligned with one or more of the four goals listed below. TOPS will periodically organize events for participants, to check for progress against these goals and provide a space for collaboration. 

The four goals are:
* Develop a strategic plan for open science. We describe one such model, the open science action plan, [here](https://nasa.github.io/Transform-to-Open-Science-Book/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Organizations_Open_Science_Journey.html#develop-governance-frameworks-and-policies-to-support-open-science-action-plans). Further ideas are available in the National Academies’ publication on *Open Science by Design.*
* Commit to examining the review process — this could include Reappointment, Promotion, and Tenure (RPT), funding, or projects reviews – and take action to improve the transparency, integrity, and equity of reviews. This could include identifying and measuring the impact of existing bias in the review process.
* Develop a plan or pilot a program to reward and account for open-science activities in evaluations and incentives.
* Commit to engaging with underrepresented communities in the advancement of open science. This should seek to go beyond any outreach programs already in place, to truly consider how to expand the reach of your organization. 

Additionally, TOPS asks that:
* Within a month of joining, a member of the participating organization adds the following to the JupyterBook page that TOPS will create on our Open Science Guide:
     * A brief description about how the organization supports open science
     * A summary of a Year of Open Science goal the organization will be pursuing for 2023
* Each organization commits to sending at least one representative to TOPS’ virtual forums and/or workshops
* Each organization adds a link on their website pointing to the TOPS Open Science Guide, and to encourage its members and/or employees to participate in TOPS' events

Organizations are also strongly encouraged to set a NASA Open Science certification goal, and to participate in the virtual NASA Open Science training this Summer and Fall.

## Resources

TOPS has curated resources for an organization-wide approach to open science in our [Open Science Guide](/Open_Science_Cookbook/Your_Organizations_Open_Science_Journey.md). 

Additionally, here are a few resources aligned with each of the 2023 Year of Open Science Goals:
1. To help **develop a strategic plan for open science** we recommend [the UNESCO Recommendations on Open Science](https://en.unesco.org/science-sustainable-future/open-science/recommendation) which sets out 7 areas of action to advance open science. Within that report, there are specific examples for different types of organizations.  
2. To help **examine the review process** we recommend work by [Fire and Guestrin](https://academic.oup.com/gigascience/article/8/6/giz053/5506490); [Beall](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jpclett.5b00910); and [Carpenter, Cone and Sarli](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4987709/) in analyzing the impact of traditional metrics for journal publications and research merit.
3. For **developing a pilot to reward open science activities** we highlight [this report](https://ec.europa.eu/research-and-innovation/sites/default/files/rio/report/MLE%2520OS_Final%2520Report_0.pdf) by the European Commission on Altmetrics and Rewards for open science.
4. For **engagement with underrepresented communities** we recommend exploring the [Guide to Ethical Research](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/ethical-research/ethical-research.html) by the Turing Way and the [DEI Resources](https://www.cscce.org/resources/dei/) from Center for Scientific Collaboration and Community Engagement.
